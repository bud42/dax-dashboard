DONE: per project counts of each type of assessor, or can this be on per session page?
DONE: PET data
DONE: site column on processing screen
DONE: show when data was updated, later have button to update data
DONE: group by baseline/followup
DONE: session date column on processing screen
DONE: group by site instead of project, also group by assessor type instead of project,
DONE: when selecting a project, filter out columns that don't apply
DONE: graph of sessions by time, similar to jobs

TODO: eventually have dax keep track of queue status on XNAT so we don't have to get directly from cluster
TODO: per session page with columns for scans and assessors with filters
for project, scan type (passed), assr type (passed)

TODO: selecting rows in table affect graphs
TODO: scans/assessors: if any are questionable count usable and questionable and yellow,
if no questionable and any are usable, count the usable and green,
else if all are unusable count the unusable and red
if questcount > 0, usecount+questcount,yellow
elif usecount > 0, usecount,green
else: totcount,red

# TODO: help button on each tab that explains how it operates
# TODO: info button that explains the purpose of this report and how it works

# DONE: transition from data_table_experiments to data_table, requires a lot
# of keyword changes (rows as recrods to data as rows, sortable to soring,
# filterable to filtering,
# selected_row_indices to selected_rows, columms is list of dicts instead of
# just list) and probably some formatting

# Try vertically column names, or try to make it work like redcap does, such that
# ony the table is extra wide and the controls and graph stay in place


# TODO: add a dropdown to filter by status, so we can limit the table to
# only inlcude specific status (this could be done by filter too, but this
# would be more convenient)
